POD:
1. How many containers created by default when we create pod ?
2. What will be the ip container inside pod ?
3. if mycontainer get lost from pod will it create new  or not ?
4. If i have two nodes and two pods and two containers web and db are deployed inside both pod respectively. how they can    
   communicate ? 
5. what is deployment ? why it necessary ?
6. if pod deletes and recreates will the ip will same ? ->NO 
7. what is service and why it needed ?	
8. what are types of service ?   1.clusterip 2.nodeport 3. loadbalancer 
9. why service ip used to communicate ?
10 are we need to provide service ip range (cluster_ip)? yes 
11. when to used service type  clusterip nodeport loadbalancer
12. advantages of deploying web and db in same pod?
13. which type of storage used to store data ?

KUBERNET CLUSTURE CONF :
1. on premises
2. cloud aws/azure/google
3. VM	
4. Plateform as service 





##### minicube

it is single node cluster 1node=mastenode+workernode(both same)
https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/

1. to install minicube on windows which hyperviser supports ? hyperv,oracle virtualbox


2. to install minicube on linux which hypervisor supports ? kvm , virtualbox 
3. can we do setup of minicube without hyperviser ?
	
## kubeadm

ref : https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/
multi node cluster (multiple worker and master node separaty)

requirements :
master node should be min 2 gb ram and 2 cpu 20gb hardisk
worker node 2gb 1 cpu  20gb hdd
swap memory should be off --> bcz kuberneties not allow you to store runtime data in swap .. only allow in save in ram
should install docker ,kubeadm,kubelet,kubectl install
docker -> for container creation
kubeadm ->cluster setup
kubectl --> cluster component management,
kubectl --> command line


systemctl status firewall -> check firewall status

interview: ports used by which service 

kya kubernet ke component os ke upar chalte hai ya pod -> pod ke upar
