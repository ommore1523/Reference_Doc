# ************* DOCKER-COMPOSE ***************

use for container deployment ,  Use yaml file to provisioning and deprovisoning of resources

advantage : resources creates withing the sec and delete within the sec
adtg : if the any machine crashes ..then you can use yaml file and make provison for resources 

exp: 50 container of diff config . Then you can create yaml file for 50 container . and up the file .

install docker compose :    https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/


docker-compose up -d
docker-compose down 
docker container ls
docker-compose scale <service_name=count> <service_name2=count>   ==>scale up and down (can reduce/increase )
docker-compose ps  ==> show all container that createed by compose
docker-compose stop   ==> all deplyement will stop that created by compose 
docker-compose start
docker compose restart

docker-compose --help
docker-compose up --no-start  ==> will create service but not start 
docker compose rm ==> remove stop container created by docker compose   


docker-compose -f <filename.yml> up -d  => create containers with self name given file 
docker-compose -f <filename.yml> down   => down containers with self name given file 


creating resources using json file :

google tool yaml to json 
save file using <filename.json>
docker-compose  -f cloud.json up -d


docker compose up vs docker compose build :: both used for creating resource but if you have yaml
file with no of resourced defined then up will create all of them but build will create where 
want to create/build image .

docker compose config  => view content (as like cat read only)

----||---- events => create an events what is happenning while up the file
----||---exec <composefile> <cmd> create container  and execute command      

images ,kill, pause
